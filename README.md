# Simple Tweaks
Simple Tweaks is a plugin for Dalamud that started as a way to create small additions without creating an entire plugin for a couple lines of code.
Now, Simple Tweaks has grown to the point that the whole plugin should probably be renamed, but I think it can stay as Simple Tweaks and the name can be a little joke.

Simple Tweaks aims to improve quality of life when playing the game by making small changes that improve the experience slightly.
